# rfid-playing-cards

PoC project, currently no public files.

The idea behind this project is to build a small device able to read gimmicked (stuffed with a RFID tag) playing cards, as a tool for magical purpose.

At the moment, I'm using a RC522 RDID reader, but I would like to find a smaller one if possible. Also, the results are currently sent thru a web server for fast prototyping, but it is not very convenient, I think I'll move to Bluetooth or Arduino IoT Cloud.
